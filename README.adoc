== Cerebro

Cerebro is an open alerting system over http://graphiteapp.org/[Graphite], the opensource timeseries database. The service layer currently integrates with https://github.com/scobal/seyren[Seyren] to store alarms, schedule checks and send alerts. (More backends in the future.)

Cerebro provides a service layer (REST API) and a dashboard (Web UI) to make alerting over various types of metrics more accessible to Graphite non-experts. It is dedicated to DevOps teams monitoring their product/services.

_Whereas still a beta, we already use Cerebro over various types of production metrics: system, applicative, business. We have teams and users, from ops to developers as well as product owners, which find it useful as a general-purpose open alerting service. That is why we chose to share Cerebro with the community, even though there is (much) place for improvements: scalability, resilience, API, integrations..._

== Features

* Supports alarms over http://graphiteapp.org/[Graphite] timeseries and email alerts for now. (More backends and alert types in the future.)
* Use wizard-like forms to create basic, as well as advanced alarms:
** Define basic fixed-thresholds alarms, as well as history-leveraging _targets_ (combining Graphite functions, such as `summarize`, `timeShift` or Holt-Winters forecasts)
** Follow natural-language instructions and illustrations to set alarm modes and options
** Preview data and thresholds results at each step (over 1h, 1d, 1w)
* Browse, inspect, susbscribe to existing alarms:
** Find / browse alarms and recent alerts
** Subscribe/Unsubscribe to any alarm (setting active status/weekdays/hours of notifications)
** Inspect alarm details, previews, subscribers
* Edit alarms and subscriptions in a non-blocking manner:
** Enable/Disable, edit or duplicate existing alarms (no owner - subscribers will be notified instead)
** Enable/Disable, edit and delete subscriptions (when no subscription remains, the alarm is deleted to)
* Leverage the REST API for programmatic usage (deploy alarms automatically with applications?)
* Browse basic stats over alarms, alerts and subscribers
* Get online help, links, info:
** Contextual help from every page, aka _Prof. Xavier_ (using http://introjs.com/[Intro.js])
** Customizable links to your wiki, chatroom, issues, mailing list...
** Technical details about the version (commit, author, build job, etc.)
** API online documentation (with http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI])

NOTE: Questions about existing/missing features and supports? auth? alarm ownership?... Please check the FAQ wiki.

== Getting started

The following instructions show how to create an alarm with Cerebro, as well as several other features, running everything locally as https://www.docker.com/[Docker] containers.

* Install https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] and https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose].

* Build Cerebro:

    $ mvn clean verify

* Run Cerebro over fresh Graphite+Seyren backends as containers:

    $ cd docker
    $ docker-compose up

* Open the Cerebro dashboard on http://localhost (IP may differ for Docker Toolbox and VM users).
* Once the dashboard is loaded, click on the _Prof. Xavier_ button to get a short description of what you see. Click on _Learn more..._ to get more info and a bunch of external links.

* Create your first alarm:
** Open _Create an alarm..._,
** Enter some title and description,
** Set the Graphite _target_, for instance `carbon.agents.*.cpuUsage`, then check the _Preview..._ to verify there actually are values in the backend,
** In _Next_ step, select a _Time range (summarize)_ function, such as the _Average_ value over the last hour,
** In _Next_ step, set some _Fixed thresholds_ values for warnings/errors, then check the _Preview..._ to see the results of smoothing and thresholds,
** In _Next_ steps, configure email notifications (who, what, when), check the summary then _Finish_ saving the alarm.

* From the alarm page, scroll to _Subscribers_ then _Subscribe..._ another email with different notification params, try disabling or editing a subscription (the buttons on the cards) or the alarm itself.

* When back to the _All alarms_ page, verify your first alarm is visible. Click it to go back to details.

* Cerebro Docker containers won't actually send emails (no SMTP configured), but congratulations: you've just created your first alarm and subscriptions with Cerebro.

== User documentation

In addition to comments and labels in the user interface, the dashboard _Prof. Xavier_ button provides contextual information from for every page.

Cerebro has been used to perform an https://cfp.devoxx.fr/2017/talk/JZK-8395/Introduction_a_la_detection_d'anomalies_avec_Graphite[introduction to Graphite-based anomaly detection] at Devoxx France. The talk is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw49lm0hTH4[available online] (in French).

More user documentation will come soon.

== Installation / Configuration

See the link:INSTALL.adoc[INSTALL.adoc] file for installation and configuration instructions, as well as general information about dependencies, integrations, etc.

== Code structure

* `dashboard` : graphical user interface, running https://angular.io/[Angular] (https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript], http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap], etc.)
* `docker` : https://www.docker.com/[Docker] / https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Compose] implementation to run a Graphite+Mongo+Seyren+Cerebro stack of containers
* `selenium` : http://www.seleniumhq.org/[Selenium] integration tests over dashboard features
* `services` : REST API over backends, running https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] / https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html[Java]
